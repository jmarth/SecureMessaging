# This a prototype. It will have poorly written code and bugs. 
Many things need to be changed in order for this to be truly secure and efficient. For example passwords are currently being hashed on the server side and not the client side, passwords currently do not have salt, if a message is unsuccessfully decrypted after three tries it is only deleted from the view and not the database, and etc..
